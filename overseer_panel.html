                // Define an array of items
                const mutations = ['<h3>Heightened Pheromones</h3> <br /> &emsp; For centuries humans have searched for the perfect perfume to render those bearing their affection powerless in resisting their advances. Thankfully for most this is just a fantasy, however exposure to microbial lifeforms carrying active FEV has given your scent glands an evolutionary boost above all your rivals. Lower the difficulty of all Charisma checks by one and reroll the first complication on your turn when not wearing power armor or protective face-wear. This may also have the unintended complications of attracting those in which you have no interest in, or turning a friendly bartering opportunity into the choice between an uncomfortable night or burning an important bridge.', '<h3>Syndrome X</h3> <br /> &emsp; When normal humans age, their strands of DNA become less potent as they are damaged or regenerated improperly. Depending on diet and exercise, these affects can be held at bay, but can never truly be halted. Thanks to your exposure, you no longer have to fear this eminent deadline. You can still be killed by physical trauma or diseases and poisons; your cells will make near perfect copies of themselves while replicating naturally, effectively causing your body to age one tenth the speed of normal human beings. You must still sleep, eat, and drink as usual, and significant physical trauma can still alter this expectancy.', '<h3>Fainting Spells</h3> <br /> &emsp; Although this effect only lasts for twenty four hours, it can be quite severe. Upon becoming agitated or anxious your body reacts in possibly the worst way imaginable by shutting down entirely. On each of your turns in combat, roll an Endurance + Survival check, Difficulty 1. Passing allows you to take your turn as normal, while failing causing you to lose your main action, and a Complication immediately causes you to fall unconscious for 1d4 turns. You drop anything you are carrying in your hands and must then spend a minor action to stand back up at the end of this duration.', '<h3>Progeria</h3> <br /> &emsp; Radiation have caused irreparable damage to your cells, causing them to degenerate rapidly as they replicate. Injuries will still heal at their usual rate, but each time your skin is damaged, it loses more elasticity and circulation. For each year that passes in game, your character now ages five. If they received significant injuries during this time, they instead age a total of ten years.', '<h3>Unstable Mutation</h3> <br /> &emsp; When most people are exposed to FEV it is quickly apparent whether or not their cells can find any benefit from the interaction. You on the other hand are special. Your body cannot decide one way or the other whether to welcome the changes happening to it or fight them off. <br /> &emsp; This balance seems to only be affected by further radiation, requiring an Endurance + Survival check at Difficulty 2 any time you suffer a point of unprevented radiation damage. Passing this check means that things are stable, for now, however failing causes an alteration to your genetics. <br /> &emsp; Roll any die against your Luck, (evens or odds). Now roll 1d8 to determine which attribute is affected, (1 Strength, 2 Perception, 3 Endurance, 4 Charisma, 5 Intelligence, 6 Agility, 7 Luck, 8 All Attributes). If you matched your Luck with an &#697even or odd&#697 result, increase this score or scores by one. If you did not match your Luck on the &#697even or odd&#697 roll, decrease this score or scores by one. <br /> &emsp; If you rolled a complication during this process, treat your character as if they were freshly exposed to a source of FEV and roll a new mutation on the main chart. <br /> &emsp; <b>Radaway does not cure this mutation, however healing the radiation damage resets all alterations to your character in terms of Attributes.</b>', '<h3>Chem Weakness</h3> <br /> &emsp; Pre-war chems are already a bit dodgy two centuries after their expiration dates, and the ones made after the bombs dropped have a tendency to contain the not-so-secret ingredient of radiation. Most people have such a low tolerance, only a few doses can cause a severe reaction or addiction. After your exposure to an FEV source you have become especially sensitive, rolling double the Combat Dice when determining Addictions but also receiving twice the benefit from chems as a normal human, (or the same effects as a human if you are a ghoul).', '<h3>Silent Mutation</h3> <br /> &emsp; Many small changes to the DNA can go unnoticed for generations. These long term effects can be positive or negative depending on how the altered cells pass on through the bloodlines. Although you will never notice any discernable changes from your exposure, your grandchildren may not be so lucky.', '<h3>Sustenance</h3> <br /> &emsp; Calories can be hard to come by in the wastes, and many different organisms have found ways to adapt to this harsh new fact of life. After being exposed to a source of FEV, your body responded by making improvements to the way it not only breaks down energy, but also how it uses it. Though your taste buds may need some time to catch up with this evolutionary boon, you can now consume spoiled or raw food with no consequences to your health. Working with greater efficiency, this food sits longer in your digestive tract so that all nutrients can be fully extracted from it, allowing you to feel sated for much longer periods of time then that of a normal human.  <br /> &emsp; When calculating Fatigue from hunger, you remain full for four hours, sated for eight hours, peckish for sixteen hours, hungry for thirty-two hours, and finally begin to starve after two days without food. Concerning thirst, you are quenched for two hours, hydrated for four hours, thirsty for eight hours, and become dehydrated after sixteen hours.  <br /> &emsp; This does not protect you from disease or poisons, only natural decomposition and the microbial life that typically forms in the process.', '<h3>Corrosive Blood</h3> <br /> &emsp; After being exposed to FEV, a few curious changes took place in your physiology. On the upside, you now find yourself completely immune to diseases causes by bacteria, parasites, or any other microbial organisms that are organically based. The tradeoff however is that your blood has now become incredibly acidic and will dissolve any other living thing it comes in contact with, including healthy human blood. This turns all routine operations and injuries into potentially life-threatening experiences, as you cannot receive a transfusion no matter how desperate your situation is. <br /> &emsp; When taking an Injury there is a chance that those in your vicinity will be exposed to your blood and will be subject to its acidic qualities. Each living being within Close-Quarters distance from you must immediately make an Agility + Luck, (max TN 19, and no AP can be generated with this roll) at Difficulty 2, or suffer from exposure. A complication doubles the damage and effects below as the corrosive fluids get in a sensitive area like the eyes or mouth. <br /> &emsp; Roll 4cd to determine the effect coming into contact with this blood has on anything organic it touches. It deals no base damage but is considered to cause Poison damage and have the &#697Vicious&#697 and &#697Persistent&#697 Damage Effect. It cannot harm synthetics, and therefore does not affect targets entirely protected by hazmat suits or power armor.', '<h3>Healing Factor</h3> <br /> &emsp; Your cells can now replicate and repair themselves faster than any other mammal in the animal kingdom. This ability not only allows you to recover from injuries that would permanently cripple normal humans, but also regrow or reattach limbs. Regain 1 HP at the start of each of your turns. Crippled limbs will automatically recover after five minutes. Severed limbs can be reattached by holding both stumps together for one minute. Regrown limbs take twenty-four hours to completely form. <br /> &emsp; This ability comes with a steep tradeoff, as you will require more food and water to fuel the constant regeneration going on in your body. You only remain full for a half hour, sated for two hours, peckish after four hours, hungry after eight hours, and begin to starve after sixteen hours without food. In terms of thirst, you will only be quenched for a half hour, hydrated for an hour, you become thirsty after two hours, and dehydrated in just four hours.', '<h3>Thin Blood</h3> <br /> &emsp; Exposure has caused your blood platelets to shrink in size, having several effects on your new physiology. Your circulation greatly improves, allowing you to reroll any die when making a Survival check to resist the elements, and you almost never suffer from headaches. This does however make surgery and first aid more complicated, transferring +1 Difficulty to all Medicine rolls to treat an injury or stop Persistent damage unless clotting agents are used.', '<h3>Thicken Blood</h3> <br /> &emsp; Your blood platelets rapidly enlarge, causing you to suffer from an almost constant string of headaches. This ailment can be held at bay with a 1/2 dose of Med X or blood thinners but can never truly be counter acted. In exchange, it reduces Medicine rolls performed on you by one, (to a minimum of zero), which included most types of Persistent damage at the discretion of your GM. ', '<h3>Stone Limbs</h3> <br /> &emsp; Evolving rapidly over the course of the next few days, your bones begin to harden and calcify over existing damage. This extra density increases your characters HP by twice your Endurance and allows you resist Injuries by rolling Endurance + Survival at a Difficulty equal to the number of Injuries taken from the attack. This increased mass comes at a cost however, raising all Agility Difficulties by one and raising the Complication Range of all Athletic checks by two. Finally, you take one and a half times normal damage from falling.', '<h3>Touch of Mutation</h3> <br /> &emsp; After coming in contact with FEV, you have transformed into a living conduit for others that wish to experience a change. You are immune to further mutation, however not to radiation itself, and anyone coming in physical contact with you will be treated as if being directly exposed to FEV. Mutations can only occur once per in game week, exposure past this limit causes 2cd of radiation damage instead. Using a dose of Rad X will nulify this ability for the duration of the medicine.', '<h3>Touch of Health</h3> <br /> &emsp; Instead of turning green or mutating into a hideous pool of goo, the FEV has had some truly beneficial effects on your health. Blemishes and ailments seem to wane and disappear, your hair and nails take on a natural sheen, and you find that laying your hands on others can have some miraculous results. When using a major action to firmly grab on to an exposed area of skin, your target regains 2cd of HP. When an effect is rolled, this also removes an Injury if one is present. This ability has no effect on your own body however, although you find yourself with increased resistance to foreign bodies. Raise Poison DR by 2 and add one die to checks made to resist a disease.', '<h3>Touch of Radiation</h3> <br /> &emsp; After your recent exposure, a large amount of residual radioactive contaminants has been stored inside your body. This process has given immunity to radiation damage in the process, however not to further mutation due to exposure. Those coming in physical contact with you, (grappling not Unarmed), take 3cd of Radiation damage with the Persistent Damage Effect. To use this as an attack, make an Unarmed attack as normal. If you attack hits, use the radiation damage in lieu of traditional damage as you must clamp your hand down on your target to transfer the rads. Although brief contact does not cause damage, those camping with you must make an Endurance + Survival check each night to resist 1cd of Radiation damage for being in close proximity to a highly irradiated source.', '<h3>Cyrokinesis</h3> <br /> &emsp; See <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tuuP8hwS7dpmq_K0hYuxIySYQg9OyNdS/view">the Psyker Compendium</a>.', '<h3>Radiation Burns</h3> <br /> &emsp; A small fission reaction takes place on your epidermis, causing severe burns due to radiation. This damage is so hot and fast that it tends to leave disfiguring scars on the unfortunate souls that have suffered from it. The part of you that has come in contact with the FEV takes 4cd of radiation damage with the Vicious Damage Effect. If a limb is crippled this way, it requires surgery or cybernetics to restore function to. If the head or torso are crippled, your character falls into a coma and must receive medical intervention to survive.', '<h3>Dogman Disease</h3> <br /> &emsp; Otherwise known as Hypertrichosis, this disease causing the subject to grow hair all over their body. Often seen in history as evidence of lycanthropy or communion with dark forces, this mutation doesn&#697t make it any easier to fit in across the wastes. It has little function besides extra insulation, and typically isn&#697t much of a hindrance either outside of social interactions. Lower Survival Difficulties by one if the check is to resist the elements but increase all Charisma Difficulties by one as well.', '<h3>Putrid Growths</h3> <br /> &emsp; Horrid disfigurements begin to sprout from your exposed flesh painfully after your exposure to FEV. These discolored cists can rupture easily, leaking foul smelling radioactive puss and blood that cause further agony. Take 5cd of Radiation damage with the Piercing Damage Effect. Lower Charisma to 1 and add 1cd with the Radioactive Damage Effect to any further damage taken while suffering from this condition. Removing all rads will cure this ailment.', '<h3>Disease Resistance</h3> <br /> &emsp; Instead of weakening your immune system, exposure to FEV has left it stronger than ever. When rolling to resist diseases add one die to your checks for free, (counts as spending AP for perk purposes, and still counts towards maximum of 5), and lower the Difficulty by one.', '<h3>Mutation Resistance</h3> <br /> &emsp; After resisting the effects of FEV your body has become more resilient against future exposure. Although you still receive radiation damage as usual, you may resist mutations with Endurance + Survival at Difficulty 2. This is not a conscious choice and must be rolled each time you come in contact with FEV despite whether it is voluntary or not. Resisting FEV this way counts towards your once-per-week limit of mutations, and further contact causes radiation damage instead as normal.', '<h3>Radiation Resistance</h3> <br /> &emsp; Although this does not protect you from further mutating from FEV exposure, you now find yourself much more resistant to harmful radiation. Raise Radiation DR on all areas of the body by three. You may also remove up to three rads immediately after gaining this mutation.', '<h3>Chameleon Mutation</h3> <br /> &emsp; Your body has mutated and evolved advanced Iridophores that can replicate the color and textures of your environment. This ability only effects your exposed skin and therefor has several limitations as follows. <br /> &emsp; Although not requiring an action to begin, you must be moving slowly and concentrating to keep up the charade. You may not take the Sprint action, and once an attack is performed the bonus from the ability is lost until you can successfully evade detection again. <br /> &emsp; Having distractions in the form of gear greatly reduces the effectiveness of this mutation. When carrying a load heavier then 3/4 ths your maximum carry capacity, this ability does not function at all. When above 1/2 carry capacity, you may reroll one die during a Sneak attempt. When at 1/3rd capacity you may also add an extra die to your Sneak attempts for no extra AP cost, (still counts towards max), and at 1/4 carry capacity lower Sneak Difficulties by one as well, to a minimum of zero.', '<h3>Sensory Neuropathy</h3> <br /> &emsp; FEV radiation has had an interesting effect on your nervous system. Although you have not lost sensitivity to touch, your pain receptors have mutated and no longer send the traditional signals to your brain. This does not prevent you from the psychological effects of seeing your own body injured, however you will never again be held back by the physical aspects of injuries. Lower the Difficulty of Medicine checks used to treat you by one, (to a minimum of zero). Your uncanny ability to sit still despite lacking any anesthesia makes you a favorite patient of many doctors, making their job just a little easier when they are trying to patch you up.', '<h3>Scent</h3> <br /> &emsp; Developing several million scent receptors over the next week, your sense of smell becomes inhumanly more developed. At first the sensitivity may be uncomfortable, however soon this ability reveals an entire new layer to the world around you. When you nose is not covered by a respirator or closed helmet, you gain the following bonuses. <br /> &emsp; You may track targets you are intimately familiar with Perception + Survival at Difficulty 1 as long as some of their scent remains. If attempting to track a target you are only briefly acquainted with, raise the Difficulty to 2, and if you are trying to locate someone based off an article of their clothing or similar focus, this Difficulty is raised to 3. Whether or not scent remains in the area is at GM discretion, as many factors such as weather and wind direction will be considered in their decision. <br /> &emsp; When attempting to detect someone that is sneaking or hiding, you may add one die to your dice pool as if spending AP, (max 5), and lower the Difficulty by one, (min 0). Beating the Difficulty by two or more will allow you to discern the exact location, while anything less will give you a vague direction.', '<h3>Tolerance</h3> <br /> &emsp; Exposure to FEV has tempered your body against several forms of damage. Raise you Physical, Energy, Radiation, and Poison DR by 2. You may also roll an extra die when making a Survival check to resist the elements or diseases.', '<h3>Bird Bones Syndrome</h3> <br /> &emsp; You bones elongate slightly and lose much of their original density. Despite this, they have avoided becoming brittle by increasing their flexibility with mutated cartilage. You now take 1/2 damage from falling and add two points to Agility, (this can exceed 10). As a tradeoff, you lose two points of Strength and divide your maximum carrying capacity by half.', '<h3>Amphibious Mutation</h3> <br /> &emsp; As the days slowly turn into a week, your body undergoes a series of changes that alters your physiology to be better adapted to a wet climate. <br /> &emsp; The webbing between your hands and toes expands to grant you increased mobility while submerged. While swimming, lower all Athletic Difficulties by one and treat it like a Tagged skill if it is not already. This extra skin is elastic but can still get in the way. Raise all Complication ranges by 1 when using your hands for a task. <br /> &emsp; Increased lung capacity grants you the ability to hold your breath for up to ten minutes, however speaking greatly reduces this timeframe. Any damage dealt to your torso while holding your breath will cause you to expel the air you have trapped inside of you. <br /> &emsp; You skin also takes on an elastic quality while most of the hair the doesn&#697t grow on your head falls out. You must submerge yourself once every twelve hours to prevent painful skin conditions from developing due to lack of moisture. Certain oils and lotions can be used to mitigate these conditions, however there is nothing like a bath of purified water to take away the sting. <br /> &emsp; This mutation can stack with the Aqua Boy/Girl Perk, increasing the time you may hold your breath up to twenty minutes, removing the radiation damage, and increasing stealth depending on levels invested.', '<h3>Amnesia</h3> <br /> &emsp; FEV radiation causes synapses in your brain to degenerate and grow new pathways that confuse and addle your sense of time. Make an Intelligence + Luck check, (cannot gain AP through this roll, max 19), Difficulty 5. No matter your successes, if a Complication is rolled you immediately suffer from true amnesia. This means your character will forget exactly who and what they are for a period of time equal to fifteen days minus your Intellect attribute. If no Complications are rolled, your character instead suffers from a milder form of amnesia for this time period. They will forget the events that have taken place for the past several weeks or months at GM discretion. For each success rolled subtract one day from the duration of the fugue state whether Complications were rolled or not. This allows for a character with 10 Intelligence to avoid these penalties altogether if they also score five successes on their roll to resist.', '<h3>Gluttony Adaptation</h3> <br /> &emsp; Having been exposed to some form of FEV, the lining of your stomach has thickened and grown specialized muscles and calcium deposits to break down all the new additions to your evolving diet. Concentrated acids digest materials toxic or otherwise inedible to humans, allowing you to eat just about anything. You still take rads from food normally but can now include junk items and other synthetic materials on your daily menu in a pinch or just to show off. This mutation does not affect the rest of your body, however it does let you consume sharp and dangerous objects with no threat to your internal health. How much sustenance you can gain from this new food source is up to GM discretion.', '<h3>Gift of Youth</h3> <br /> &emsp; Regenerating old strands of your DNA from memories stored within your cells, your body rapidly regresses into an earlier state. This effect can be quite jarring, as the entire process takes only twenty-four hours, however to some this is truly a miracle. Roll 1cd for every ten years old your character is, (rounding down). Reduce your character&#697s age by a number of years equal to the damage rolled, counting effects rolled as five. Your GM may decide to alter your attributes accordingly, shifting points of Strength to Agility and points of Endurance to Luck at their discretion.', '<h3>Photographic Memory</h3> <br /> &emsp; After exposure to FEV you find yourself being able to recall details about prior events in perfect detail. This includes the ability to perform advanced thought experiments similar as to Nikola Tesla and Albert Einstein. Increase Intellect and Perception by two points. This can exceed the normal maximum of ten. You may now ask the GM specific questions OOCly in regard to past events but are encouraged to take notes which you are allowed to refer to at any time. You may also ask for a time-out to think for a moment so long as this does not slow down the momentum of your game and will be granted at GM discretion.', '<h3>Mortify</h3> <br /> &emsp; FEV exposure has temporary damaged your cells and halted their ability to regenerate. You do not regain HP from resting, eating, or Medicine checks, and only regain half the normal HP from Stimpacks. This effect lasts for a number of days equal to eleven minus your Endurance attribute. While suffering from this condition you gain +2 DR to Radiation damage.', '<h3>Monstrous Growth</h3> <br /> &emsp; Having a particularly chaotic reaction to FEV exposure, your body ripples and contorts as newly formed limbs burst forth from random areas of your body. Sometimes these limbs are functioning, other times they fail to fuse to the nervous system and hang like dead weight from the body. A Medicine check Difficulty 3 can be made to remove limbs; however, any Complications can easily kill the patient as the body perceives these new appendages the same way it does the arms and legs you were born with. <br /> &emsp; Roll 1d4 to determine how many new limbs your body produces, and a random hit die to determine where. Arms grow above the waist, while legs grow below. On a &#697head&#697 result a new head begins to form just above the neck. Now roll 1cd per new appendage. <br /> &emsp; On a blank result this limb is attached to your circulatory system but not to your nerves, meaning it is completely unusable. Lower Agility by one for each limb grown this way and subtract 10 lbs from your maximum carry capacity. <br /> &emsp; On a damage result, a limited nervous system has been connected, but lacks finer movements and control. For each limb grown this way, lower Agility by one but raise Endurance by one in contrast. If this appendage is an arm, you may also take an extra minor action each turn, (that cannot be used for movement), or increase your carry capacity by 25 lbs if this extra limb is a leg. In the event a head is partially formed, it may be used for simple tasks such as eating or drinking, allowing you to remain alert and watchful or otherwise free to concentrate on another task. <br /> &emsp; On an effect result, a fully formed appendage is formed and is tied directly into your nervous, circulatory, and musculature systems, each raising Endurance by 1 point. if this appendage is an arm, increase Strength by 1 and you may take an additional major action each turn, (that cannot be used for movement), if your result is a leg increase your Agility by 1 and raise carry capacity by 50 lbs, and finally, if it is a new head, raise Perception by 1 and you may negate all penalties for being caught unaware when making a roll to detect abnormalities in your environment. <br /> &emsp; No matter how these mutations are formed, raise all future Charisma Difficulties by 2. Even those not offended by these abnormalities will likely still take advantage of your situation as mutants of your caliber are shunned from many settlements operating off superstitions and fear. Regardless of how the appendages are formed, raise HP by half your Endurance for each limb gained this way. Attributes can be raised above 10 if increased by this mutation.', '<h3>The Blue Flu</h3> <br /> &emsp; Currently in a dormant state, it is likely that you will never know the true nature of the mutated virus that is now hiding out in your cells. Manifesting in a way much closer to the tradition flu, those that recover see no other indication that the risk of contagion remains, however a fertility test will reveal that they have become sterile. A silent harbinger of doom, those that come in contact with your bodily fluids remain at risk at spreading this sleeping virus to others. Although not caused by FEV exposure, it was an important precursor and was widely believed to have been created by the pre-war government. <br /> &emsp; Although considered a relatively minor flu, raise the Difficulty of all Perception and Intelligence checks by one for a number of days equal to fifteen minus your Endurance attribute. You may further attempt an Endurance + Survival roll to reduce symptoms, removing one more day for each success you achieve, (max 5).', '<h3>Radio-wave Sensitivity</h3> <br /> &emsp; What begins as static and senseless noises slowly transforms into an ability to detect radio signals without the help of any technology. As your brain learns how to decipher these new stimuli, you find yourself able to listen to regular broadcasts and communications. This allows you to also track the source of the signals, requiring an Intelligence + Survival check at Difficulty 2 to get a sense of direction. This ability has a range of approximately 10 x Perception in meters.', '<h3>Shift</h3> <br /> &emsp; Although your memories remain unchanged, your body undergoes a rapid transformation as you switch biological genders. This physiological change will likely have more psychological challenges than genetic, however the details will be between you and your GM. Regardless of your new equipment, the mutation causes positive traits to express themselves more prominently. You may now reroll the first Complication you receive during any Charisma check.', '<h3>Discombobulate</h3> <br /> &emsp; Addling your body and mind, you find yourself losing quality of life in some areas, while gaining some in others. Roll 2d8s separately to determine your first attributes to be modified, (1 Strength, 2 Perception, 3 Endurance, 4 Charisma, 5 Intelligence, 6 Agility, 7 Luck, 8 roll again twice, cannot be rolled a second time.). Lower these attributes by 1. Repeat the process again and raise the attributes rolled by 1 now instead. This lasts until a Radaway is used to clear up the mutation and can be suppressed for a scene with Rad X in a pinch.', '<h3>Unstable Isotope</h3> <br /> &emsp; You feel a tingling sensation in your skin for a few hours after your exposure to FEV. When struck in melee combat, an unstable reaction occurs, and a burst of atomic energy is released in your vicinity. You are not immune to this effect either and take the same 3cd of Radiation damage as your attackers and allies within close quarters range each time you are struck. A dose of Rad X can hold this effect temporarily at bay, however a total of three separate doses of Radaway will be required to fully cure the condition. With each dose, remove 1cd from the effect above until it reaches 0.', '<h3>The Black Sweats</h3> <br /> &emsp; An oily, tar-like substance begins to ooze from your pores until the radioactive contaminants are pushed out of your body. This is not particularly painful but is accompanied by a foul odor not unlike sulfur. Increase Charisma Difficulties by one, and the Complication Range by two for the next week as your body recovers. A successful Medicine check, (Difficulty 2), can be used in tandem with a harsh cleaning agent, (such as isopropyl alcohol), to negate these effects for up to eight hours. This process must be repeated if your character makes an Athletics attempt at GM discretion.', '<h3>Gray Sight</h3> <br /> &emsp; FEV has caused damage to the sensitive cones on your retina that are responsible for identifying color. You are now limited to a world that is cast in shades of grey, the vibrancy of colors quickly becoming little more than a memory. Raise Perception Difficulties by one that rely on sight in good or dim light, and increase these Difficulties by two in total, or near-total darkness.', '<h3>Tongues</h3> <br /> &emsp; After coming in contact with a source of FEV your frontal lobe evolves further to understand all written and spoken languages. This understanding is open to some interpretation, as your brain is capable of making sense of most characters, but not the grammar or subtleties behind it. You must still learn to speak new languages as normal and must also own an example of what you wish to study.', '<h3>Enlightenment</h3> <br /> &emsp; Beginning as a strange sort of vision that is different for each subject, most report a euphoric feeling and a serene sense of calm during the experience. This does not dull your senses, and in fact grants you an extra d20 to all rolls throughout the duration as you feel overwhelmingly confident and collected. At the end of this altered mindset, you feel immediately enlightened and closer to accomplishing your goals. <br /> &emsp; Roll 1d6. On a 1 you gain enough experience to achieve the next level for your character. On a 2 you may Tag one additional Skill, (does not increase it). On a 3 gain an extra Perk, (must meet all requirements). On a 4 gain Skill points to spend equal to your Intelligence, (cannot exceed maximum dictated by current level). On a 5 your GM may reveal something personal about your character that they might not have otherwise understood. On a 6 the GM may reveal something about the current story, although they are encouraged to use this as a plot device rather than spoiling something they put time and effort into building up.', '<h3>Addle</h3> <br /> &emsp; Having a distinctly negative reaction to your FEV exposure, thankfully this effect is only temporary. Reduce all attributes by one. Perks you no longer meet the requirements for become inactive, and your derived stats much change accordingly. If this would cause your Endurance to drop below 1 your character falls into a coma until the condition can be cured. Removing this affliction is as simple as taking a dose of Radaway, and has no lasting effects.', '<h3>Vestigial Growth</h3> <br /> &emsp; Activating primitive strands of DNA that have long ago been discarded during the evolutionary process, your body grows a new vestigial appendage over the course of the next week. Roll 1d6. On a 1 this manifests as a short stubby tail with extra vertebrae. On a 2 your nail beds deepen and turn into sharpened talons of keratin. On a 3 a sixth toe appears on the inside of each foot. On a 4 an extra row of inverted teeth form behind your existing ones. On a 5 you grow several non-functioning organs. Finally, on a 6 your ears grow to twice their size but droop over themselves due to their own weight. <br /> &emsp; A tail serves no purpose besides making intimate encounters more uncomfortable. Though it is connected to the circulatory system, it does not have any nerves and therefor is unusable. It can be removed successfully with an Intelligence + Medicine check, Difficulty 2. <br /> &emsp; Having claws does grant you +1cd to Unarmed attacks, however it increases the complication range of all ranged attacks by two due to the loss in coordination. With a sufficiently sharp knife or grinder you can trim these nails back to a more manageable length, effectively negating the penalties they cause at GM discretion. <br /> &emsp; The sixth toe grows closer to your heel than the ball of your foot and makes wearing normal footwear impossible. It comes complete with a sturdy bone that cannot be removed easily, even by a talented surgeon. A surgical amputation requires an Intelligence + Medicine check at Difficulty 3 to perform, and regardless of success leaves you unbalanced until you undergo the long road of recovery, lowering Agility by 1. <br /> &emsp; The small, needle-like teeth that form inside your mouth do not point straight like the ones your were born with. Instead, they face backwards, ensuring that any prey caught by mouth cannot escape. As most people tend to kill and cook their meals before ingestion, this serves little function outside a creepy party trick. <br /> &emsp; Vestigial organs have little effect in game but can cause so psychological pain when one looks down at themselves to find new bulges of internal meat. Not on any medical chart, it is more difficult to perform surgeries or first aid as the doctor must first determine the potential risks of exploring unknown territory. Raise all Medicine Complications by four when you are the target of the check. <br /> &emsp; Similar to a domesticated dog, your ears double in size but cannot support their own weight, causing them to hang down the sides of your head comically. This still benefits you in a small way when attempting to detect sound, allowing you to reroll the first Complication when making a Perception + Survival roll. With most considering your condition quite absurd, you find it hard to get other people to take you seriously. Raise all Charisma Difficulties by one.', '<h3>Proteus Syndrome</h3> <br /> &emsp; A particularly nasty mutation, one of your limbs begins to swell and contort painfully. Enlarging past the point of functionality, it will be counted as crippled until proper treatment can be rendered. Roll 1d4, corresponding a result of 1 with the Right Arm, 2 with the Left Arm, 3 with the Right Leg, and finally 4 with the Left Leg. If an arm is affected; raise all Difficulties in tasks that would benefit from having two hands by one. If this is your dominant arm increase this penalty to 2. If a leg was affected; divide your Agility and carry weight in half. <br /> &emsp; Treatment consists of several Stimpack injections and a full course of Radaway treatment. You must have an attending doctor, though they may only make one roll per day to treat you. Have them roll an Intelligence + Medicine at Difficulty 1. AP generated from this roll does not go to the party, but instead is cumulated to treat the mutation. Once ten AP have been added to this side-pool the mutation is removed, and healthy function to the limb is restored. For each day you remain in treatment you will require one Stimpack, and one dose of Radaway to continue making progress. Remove 1 AP from this side-pool for each day that passes without getting additional treatment or meeting the Chem requirements for recovery.', '<h3>The Godhand</h3> <br /> &emsp; Extreme temperament from FEV exposure has left your hands as hard as stone. This ability allows you to accomplish feats with your hands that seem impossible, including punching through solid synthetic objects as if they were made of paper. Both of your arms gain 3 Physical DR. In addition, your unarmed strikes gain an extra 3cd of damage as well as the Piercing Damage Effect. ', '<h3>Wasteland Whisperer</h3> <br /> &emsp; Exposure to FEV has given your frontal lobe the ability to interpret the body language and intonation of animals into discernible motives or desires. This does not give you the ability to reason with these critters, however it will allow you to understand their current mindset simply by observing them. You may attempt to communicate through similar movements and sounds, rolling Charisma + Survival at Difficulty 2. This has a more profound effect on more intelligent creatures but is limited to simple directions. You may cause a creature to flee, attack a specific target or group, or convey that your group is not a threat. Even with a successful check, these are living being that will look out for their best interest above all else. They will not sacrifice themselves to save members of the party, nor will they give up a meal on an empty stomach.', '<h3>Marsupial Mutation</h3> <br /> &emsp; Extra muscles grow and attach themselves to multiple points along your legs while you find your thoughts increasingly more difficult to articulate. You may now use a minor action to Sprint so long as you are moving vertically, with a maximum jump distance of over sixteen feet, or about five meters. This mutation has a serious downside however, and you lose two Intelligence until it has been cured. <br /> &emsp; Treatment consists of two Radaway doses, one at the base of the neck, and one at the base of the spine. It must be administered by a qualified physician, requiring an Intelligence + Medicine check at Difficulty 3 with a Complication range of four.', '<h3>Mediumship</h3> <br /> &emsp; See <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tuuP8hwS7dpmq_K0hYuxIySYQg9OyNdS/view">the Psyker Compendium</a>.', '<h3>Regenerate</h3> <br /> &emsp; You have an immediate reaction to your exposure. You regain all HP, restore all crippled limbs, remove all rads, and eliminate any addictions you are suffering from. For each one of these effects that you benefit from, lower your Hunger and Thirst by one state. That means if you restore your HP and any number of crippled limbs, your Hunger goes from full to <h3>peckish, and your Thirst goes from quenched too thirsty. As you heal and feel renewed, the energy stores in your body are rapidly depleted as they are consumed for fuel.', '<h3>Radiation Allergy</h3> <br /> &emsp; Developing a sensitivity to atomic energy after your exposure to FEV, you must go out of your way to avoid the many irradiated areas across the wastes. Upon further exposure, double the radiation damage you receive after calculation. This affect can be mitigated temporarily with Rad X and cured with a dose of Radaway.', '<h3>Juggernaut Syndrome</h3> <br /> &emsp; Your pituitary gland mutates and begins pumping fresh growth hormones throughout your entire body. You gain 4d6 inches to your height, 4d20 lbs in weight, outgrowing your current clothing and gear within the next twenty-four hours, though it can be modified to compensate for your size difference at GM discretion. You also gain 3 Strength and 3 Endurance, but lose 3 points of Agility and Intelligence, modifying derived stats as necessary. This condition is nearly impossible to reverse once it fully sets in and requires three separate doses of Radaway immediately after exposure to prevent the physiological changes.', '<h3>Residual Rads</h3> <br /> &emsp; Radiation has stored itself in your body and continues to irradiate all those you come in close contact with until dealt with properly. If you currently do not have any rads, add one non-preventable Radiation damage to your character when you gain this mutation. Until this damage is healed, those that make physical contact with you also take one non-preventable Radiation damage. You may use any means to remove your rads, and when you do, this condition disappears with them.', '<h3>Glow</h3> <br /> &emsp; A bright blue flash distorts your vision briefly and you take 6cd of Radiation damage with the Piercing and Vicious Damage Effects. This intense burst leaves your flesh glowing faintly with residual atomic heat, and you immediately become dehydrated. Until you remove these rads you will continue to glow, increasing Sneak Difficulties by 2 during when in dimly lit areas, and by 3 in dark areas. Although you may use any means to remove the radiation, a final dose of Radaway is needed to finally cure the condition and allow your epidermis to return to its normal complexion.', '<h3>Adrenal Reaction</h3> <br /> &emsp; When you become sufficiently injured your adrenaline spikes, allowing you to deal massive amounts of damage at the cost of your own safety. When you drop below 75% HP multiply your damage results by 25% after initial calculation but receive an additional 25% damage in turn. When you drop below 50% HP you deal an extra 50% damage after calculations and receive an extra 50% back in turn. If you drop below 25% HP you will deal an extra 75% damage with each attack, however you will also take an additional 75% damage in turn.', '<h3>Necrosis</h3> <br /> &emsp; Although this condition can be gained in several ways, your recent exposure has started you along the path to becoming a Necrotic Post-Human. By the time symptoms begin to appear it will be too late to receive any form of effective treatment. You may refer to the book on page 52 for full details on what your transformation will mean for you, but it is up to your GM exactly how long the process takes and if you can slow it down with sufficient sources of Rad X.', '<h3>Plague Walker Syndrome</h3> <br /> &emsp; This mutation may not be noticed for quite some time or it may be immediately apparent depending on the subject&#697s exposure to disease before this encounter with FEV. Irradiated white blood cells have formed in your circulatory system and feed on diseases that infect your body. This does not cure anything you have been infected with but it does mitigate the symptoms you typically suffer. This process creates a toxic waste product that is released into the air around you, causing all those within close-quarters range to take 1cd of Poison damage for each disease you have accumulated in your travels. You are unaffected by this damage however receive no protection against other kinds of poison. You may remove this condition with a dose of Radaway, however you must first completely cure any and all diseases you are suffering from to make the cure permanent.', '<h3>Electrokinesis</h3> <br /> &emsp; See <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tuuP8hwS7dpmq_K0hYuxIySYQg9OyNdS/view">the Psyker Compendium</a>.', '<h3>Insomnia</h3> <br /> &emsp; When laying down at the end of your day, this damage prevents your brain from shutting off no matter how tired you actually are. You cannot recover your Sleep state during this time unless you use a dose of Rad X to temporarily relieve the symptoms. It lasts for a number of days equal to eleven minus your Endurance Attribute but can be cured with a single dose of Radaway. This is not enough time to cause mortal danger, however hallucinations are common after twenty-four to seventy-two hours. Your GM will decide how these phantoms manifest, though they often are subconscious representations of your pain and discomfort.', '<h3>Herd Mentality Syndrome</h3> <br /> &emsp; This alteration to your physiology suddenly creates an instinctual codependency to those closest to you in your life. You gain +2 to all attributes while in a group of three or more, but when in a group of two or less you take a -2 penalty to all attributes instead. This condition affects your frontal lobe in a way that is highly resistant to Radaway. Therapy is required on top of chems, which translates into an Intelligence + Medicine check at Difficulty 3 in addition to a Radaway dose at the base of the skull. You may negate these effects temporarily with a dose of Rad X.', '<h3>Energy Medicine</h3> <br /> &emsp; See <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tuuP8hwS7dpmq_K0hYuxIySYQg9OyNdS/view">the Psyker Compendium</a>.', '<h3>Lone Wanderer Syndrome</h3> <br /> &emsp; You begin to adapt and become more self-sufficient as your body mutates. You lose 2 points of Charisma but gain 2 Intelligence as this energy is directed elsewhere in the brain. When traveling alone you develop an uncanny sense for danger that you can attribute to having total focus without needless distractions. You gain 1 Defense when you are caught without allies and may take an additional major action each turn for one less AP than usual. These bonuses disappear if you are forced to travel with even just one companion. It can be treated, however the act of asking for help in the first place may be the biggest actual hurdle to achieve. Therapy is required on top of chems to treat this condition, which translates into an Intelligence + Medicine check at Difficulty 3 in addition to a Radaway dose at the base of the skull. You may negate these effects temporarily with a dose of Rad X.', '<h3>Blood Chemist</h3> <br /> &emsp; You body gains memory of all chems you ingest beyond this point. When you become agitated, these effects may reproduce to give you an edge in survival. Keep a list handy of any chems you take after gaining this mutation. At the start of combat, you may spend 2 AP to gain the pros and cons of consuming one of the chems on this list. You do not gain any resistance to Addiction, however using the benefits of chems through this mutation cannot cause your character to become addicted to any substances. This has no effect on healing medicines, and in fact is suppressed temporarily by a dose of Rad X and cured with a treatment of Radaway.', '<h3>Temporary Insanity</h3> <br /> &emsp; FEV overwhelms your frontal lobe causing your reason and logic to fail you. Instantly activating your &#697fight or flight&#697 response, you will no longer be able to differentiate between friend or foe and must try to escape or attack anyone in your path. You are not required to fight to the death, however until your party removes themselves from blocking the exits you will continue your rampage until they do so. If no escape is available, you will not be able to cease your assaults until those around you can no longer be perceived as a threat. This can mean disarming and lying flat on the ground but can also be achieved with a Charisma + Survival check at Difficulty 3. This will not allow you to reason with the person, however you will no longer feel the need to fight unless provoked further. This effect cannot be cured, but only lasts for a number of minutes equal to fifteen minus your Intelligence attribute.', '<h3>Electrically Charged</h3> <br /> &emsp; Residual ions have stored themselves inside of your body, causing your cells to erupt in electrical energy when you are struck in melee combat. This does not give you any resistance against energy attacks, and you suffer the same damage as anyone else in your general vicinity when the arcs are discharged. This affects everyone within in close-quarters range, dealing 2cd of Energy damage with the Stun Damage Effect when you are hit by Melee or Unarmed, or 4cd of Energy damage with the Stun Damage Effect if you receive one of more Injuries from this attack instead. This can be suppressed temporarily with a dose of Rad X but requires two doses of Radaway to fully cure.', '<h3>La Plaga Viviente</h3> <br /> &emsp; This ominious tale begins when FEV was released into the atmosphere during the Great War. Unable to affect humans, bacteria, viruses, and protozoa were not so lucky. A large variety went through complex evolutions and have become a plague upon the wasteland ever since. Some are completely invisible to the naked eye, others breed in pools of mucus or infest an area with distorted fungal blooms. <br /> &emsp; One such abomination finds its way into open cuts or sores, starting off as a rather untreatable infection. The pain soon disappears however and is replaced with a numbness and mild euphoria. The wound heals quickly but a lump is left where there was exposed flesh. Oddly enough this lump does not shrink or get softer in time, instead it steadily grows and becomes increasingly more dense. <br /> &emsp; The mutated germs leech nutrients from the body like a parasite, using the ill-gotten energy to begin a more evolved life of their own. Slowly but surely, organs, teeth, eyes, and bones begin to form into a sentient being that casually hitches a ride off the side of its host&#697s body. This creature entwines itself in the organism it has implanted on and begins to reproduce as soon as it taps into the blood. Before long an entire colony has taken root so deeply that medical intervention is impossible. <br /> &emsp; Once this happens, there is little hope for what started out as a human being. Chemicals are released that slowly shut down the brain&#697s natural responses to fear, effectively preventing self-treatments that could potentially change their fate. When finally large enough to survive outside the body, they detach and scamper off into the wastes, leaving behind a gaping hole of radioactive puss and blood clots. There wounds are further at risk at infection, starting their life cycle all over again. <br /> &emsp; Treatment<ul><li>Radaway- If taken within the first twenty-four hours, all traces of this infection will disappear. Reduce the chances of doses taken after this period by 10% for every five hours that pass. Once the three-day mark has been reached, the patient will require surgical intervention to prevent further growth.</li><li>Surgery- After the third day the mutated teratoma with have embedded itself into the soft tissues and will be quickly working towards penetrating the blood vessels so they can use the body&#697s veins as a reproductive highway. Careful surgery must be performed to debride the infected tissue away from the delicate system, then directly flushed with a diluted mixture of Radaway and Stims to ensure that the area is sterile and healthy functions have been restored. If the wound was already so deep that blood vessels were cut to begin with, or more than six days have elapsed, surgery is no longer possible.</li><li>Fasting- When all else fails, or you just want to halt the problem the &#697old fashioned&#697 way, you can starve your body of nutrients and deny the parasitic microbes from developing further. This is not a comfortable process and consists of at least seven days without any sustainable amount of food or water. Small amounts of water are necessary to survive this treatment, however if you put more in than is coming out, you risk prolonging your suffering and giving the germs a chance at a resurgence.</li></ul>', '<h3>Glowing Necrosis</h3> <br /> &emsp; Although this condition can be gained in several ways, your recent exposure has started you along the path to becoming a glowing Necrotic Post-Human. By the time symptoms begin to appear it will be too late to receive any form of effective treatment. You may refer to the book on page 52 for full details on what your transformation will mean for you, but you also gain the Radiation Pulse special attack from page 356. It is up to your GM exactly how long the process takes and if you can slow it down with sufficient sources of Rad X.', '<h3>Dormant Regeneration</h3> <br /> &emsp; While this does not appear to have any effect upon exposure, dormant cells have grown inside your body that contain a complete blueprint of your DNA. If your character is killed during combat or in narrative gameplay you will wake up twenty-four hours later with full HP as long as at least 25% of your original body remains. Remove all radiation damage and Injuries as well, and reset all Hunger, Thirst, and Sleep states. This mutation will not activate if you are under the effects of Rad X.', '<h3>Purge</h3> <br /> &emsp; Through some random chance of chaos, exposure to the FEV virus causes your body to violently cleanse itself. Between a fit of vomit and diarrhea, you may remove all Radiation damage, all Mutations, and all Addictions. This does not affect your HP or any Injuries you have sustained.', '<h3>Telepathy</h3> <br /> &emsp; See <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tuuP8hwS7dpmq_K0hYuxIySYQg9OyNdS/view">the Psyker Compendium</a>.', '<h3>Empath Syndrome</h3> <br /> &emsp; Altering parts of your frontal lobe, you become fixated on those you travel with above even your own safety. You cannot help but try to coordinate them even at the cost of losing focus on keeping yourself out of harm&#697s way, transferring 2 Physical DR to each of your allies and raising all damage you receive by 2cd. This can be suppressed with a dose of Rad X temporarily but requires a bit of therapy and a dose of Radaway to fully cure. Your doctor must make an Intelligence + Medicine check at Difficulty 2 and provide the injection at the base of your skull, after which the condition clears up almost immediately.', '<h3>Sterilize</h3> <br /> &emsp; Although you suffer no obvious health conditions, your recent exposure to FEV has left you completely sterile. This sadly cannot be reversed or mitigated in any traditional way, leaving you with serious limitations if you wish to continue your bloodline.', '<h3>Egg Head Syndrome</h3> <br /> &emsp; Being exposed to FEV has greatly altered the density and composition of your cerebrum. The increased ability to think and reason comes at a steep cost to the rest of your body, as muscles and fat are rapidly consumed to fuel this new evolution. Raise your Intelligence by 4, but lower both your Strength and Endurance each by 2. A mutation that is nearly impossible to reverse, only Rad X seems to be able to temporarily interrupt the effects. This can exceed the normal maximum for the Intelligence Attribute but cannot reduce Strength or Endurance below 1.', '<h3>Pyrokinesis</h3> <br /> &emsp; See <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tuuP8hwS7dpmq_K0hYuxIySYQg9OyNdS/view">the Psyker Compendium</a>.', '<h3>Corrosive Spit</h3> <br /> &emsp; Your saliva has now become incredibly acidic and will dissolve any other living thing it comes in contact with. You are completely immune to these affects, and the change in your physiology has several other unintended benefits. <br /> &emsp; You gain a simple ranged attack as detailed below. This ability may cause your Thirst states to drop faster if used too often at your GMs discretion. You no longer catch diseases from food or water and are not affected by toxins that you ingest. This also allows you to consume spoiled food at no penalty, but you still gain Radiation damage as normal. <br /> &emsp; Roll 3cd to determine the effect coming into contact with your spittle has on anything organic it touches. It deals no base damage but is considered to cause Poison damage and have the &#697Vicious&#697 and &#697Persistent&#697 Damage Effect. It cannot harm synthetics, and therefore does not affect targets entirely protected by hazmat suits or power armor. It can only be used in close-quarters range and still suffers from a +1 Difficulty penalty for its improvised nature.', '<h3>Energize <br /> &emsp;</h3> A surge of physical energy transfers into you making you feel as if you have had a full night&#697s rest and banquet of refreshments. Raise your Hunger, Thirst, and Sleep states to full, hydrated, and rested.', '<h3>Enigma <br /> &emsp;</h3> FEV creates a true enigma out of your DNA, twisting and shaping it randomly each night as you enter REM sleep. You are now immune to gaining further mutations from FEV exposure, however at the start of each day you must roll on the Mutations chart. This mutation only lasts until you sleep for six or more hours, however you take on all the positive and negative effects during this time and they cannot be suppressed or cured as usual.', '<h3>Mind Reading</h3> <br /> &emsp; See <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tuuP8hwS7dpmq_K0hYuxIySYQg9OyNdS/view">the Psyker Compendium</a>.', '<h3>Herbivore Adaptation</h3> <br /> &emsp; Adapting to take more nutrition from flora, you in turn lose the ability to gain any nutrition from fauna.

You cannot catch a disease from this type of food but are still exposed to radiation as normal. In exchange you no longer gain any benefit from consuming meat products, whether that is your Hunger state or HP. This condition can be counteracted with a dose of Rad X temporarily but must be cured by injecting a dose of Radaway directly into the belly by a qualified physician.

You become flush and catch a mild fever, lowering your Hunger, Thirst, and Sleep states to starving, dehydrated, and exhausted.', '<h3>Curing Touch</h3> <br /> &emsp; After your recent exposure you become immune to further mutation and diseases. Furthermore, when you place your hands on someone else you find that their mutations and disease also disappear. This ability works much better the more you understand about the ailments, requiring an Intelligence + Medicine check to perform. The Difficulty begins at 1, but you must diagnose the problem before making your attempt. The Difficulty is 2 if you have a basic knowledge of the condition you are trying to cure, and it increases to Difficulty 3 if you are only aware that the patient is suffering from a mysterious ailment. This ability also requires 1 AP to activate and cannot be reduced by chems or other mutations.', '<h3>Greenskin</h3> <br /> &emsp; Exposure to FEV tints your skin with a greenish hue, offering you a small resistance against radiation if you can handle the stares you are bound to receive. Raise Radiation DR by 2 on all areas of the body and raise the Complication range of all Charisma checks by 3. This condition can be temporarily mitigated with a dose of Rad X or cured outright with a simple dose of Radaway.', '<h3>Atom Bomb Baby</h3> <br /> &emsp; This silent mutation only takes effect when you die, and thus often goes unnoticed for the rest of your life. When you are killed however, a rapid transformation happens to the gases in your body and stored fission energy causes by FEV exposure. This takes place on what would be the beginning of your next turn, and deals 20cd Physical damage with the Radioactive and Vicious Damage Effects to anyone within Close range, and 10cd Physical damage with the Radioactive Damage Effect to anyone within Medium range. Your body and gear are completely consumed in the explosion.', '<h3>Talent</h3> <br /> &emsp; Inspiration builds within your mind as FEV communicates knowledge about the world around you. You immediately gain 2cd of Skill points, (minimum 1), and may also take a new Perk, (you must meet all requirements), if either result is an effect.', '<h3>Scaly Skin Adaptation</h3> <br /> &emsp; Scale-like platelets form all over your epidermis creating a resilient shield against damage. Raise Physical and Energy DR by 3 on all areas of the body, however this extra protection doesn&#697t come without a tradeoff. When generating AP subtract the first two points from your result as if you had two points of Fatigue. You are also not able to hide this mutation easily, suffering a +1 Difficulty modifier in all future Charisma checks as well. <br /> &emsp; Removing this condition is not easy and requires an experiences physician and sterile facilities in which to perform the operation. The scales must be debrided from the flesh while flushing the wound with a concoction of Radaway and a Stimpack, and each area of the body must receive its own attention. Have your doctor roll an Intelligence + Medicine check at Difficulty 3 for each area, (head, torso, r arm, l arm, r leg, l leg), and expend one Diluted Stimpack and one Diluted dose of Radaway per attempt. To completely cure the mutation the entire body must be dealt with in this fashion within twenty-four hours. After that it is highly recommended that the treatment concludes with an additional full Stimpack to avoid permanent scaring or risk of infection.', '<h3>Speed Demon Syndrome</h3> <br /> &emsp; Increase Initiative by 3 and gain an extra minor action each turn that can only be used to reload or draw a weapon. The extra processing happening inside your brain requires more fuel to operate, leading you to grow hungry and thirsty much faster than normal humans.
